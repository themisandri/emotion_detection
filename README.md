# Emotion Detection using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms, Neural Networks and Keras
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning classification algorithms and neural networks for emotion detection in textual data. The project uses Keras, an open-source deep learning framework written in Python, for building and training the neural network.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the ISEAR dataset, which contains 7 different emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt) expressed in short texts. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and test sets.

Methodology
The project uses machine learning classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) for comparison with the neural network. The neural network architecture consists of an embedding layer, a bidirectional LSTM layer, and a fully connected output layer with softmax activation. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
